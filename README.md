Uncomplicated CSS for the future.

I have a few plans for this, but right now I'm too busy.

## Roadmap to 1.0

[ ] Write documentation (Jekyll)

[ ] Similar markup with Bootstrap's navbar

[ ] Finish rewriting color variables

[ ] Remove findColorInvert

[ ] Add some JavaScript

[ ] Create custom SVG icon set

[ ] Test compatibility with major browsers
