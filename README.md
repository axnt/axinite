Uncomplicated CSS for the future.

I have a few plans for this, but right now I'm too busy.

## Roadmap to 1.0

- [ ] Fix primary button color

- [ ] Write documentation (Jekyll + AMP)

- [ ] Similar markup with Bootstrap's navbar

- [ ] Finish rewriting color variables

- [ ] Remove findColorInvert

- [ ] Test compatibility with major browsers
